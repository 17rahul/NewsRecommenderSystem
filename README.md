# NewsRecommenderSystem


## Problem Statement
iPrint, an upcoming Indian media house that offers media and information services to the people, has decided to begin providing a more personalised experience to its customers. The companyâ€™s business extends across a wide range of media, including news and information services on sports, weather, education, health, research, stocks and healthcare.

iPrint has been managing its customer base by only recommending the most popular and similar news articles to its users. However, the recommended news articles are often not relevant to the majority of the users. And the company is not able to recommend any new content to its customers, and gradually, the company sthas started to lose such users, resulting in immense revenue loss.

In order to stay healthy in the market, iPrint needs to stay updated with time an technology advancements.

## Suggestion
A probable solution for the company to compete with other competitors is to solve the issue of revenue leakage by personalising users' tastes and introducing new content to its users at the start of the day on the home page of the application.

## Solution
Building a NEWS RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM that does below:
  - Recommend new top 10 relevant articles to a user when he/she visits the app at the start of the day

  - Recommend top 10 similar news articles that match the ones clicked by the user.

[The articles that are written in the English language must be considered.]
